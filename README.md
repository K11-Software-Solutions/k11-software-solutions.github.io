## 📰 Blog Feed & RSS

### Dynamic Blog Rendering

The blog page (`blog.md`) automatically displays all blog posts dynamically using Jekyll's Liquid templating:

**Blog Page URL:** [https://k11softwaresolutions.com/blog/](https://k11softwaresolutions.com/blog/)

```liquid
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <!-- Post title, date, author, excerpt -->
{% endfor %}
```

Posts are rendered in reverse chronological order (newest first) with:
- Post title (linked to full article)
- Publication date
- Author name (if specified)
- Excerpt/preview
- "Read More" link

### RSS Feed

The site includes an **automatically generated RSS feed** for blog subscribers:

**RSS Feed URL:** [https://k11softwaresolutions.com/feed.xml](https://k11softwaresolutions.com/feed.xml)

This feed is powered by the `jekyll-feed` plugin and includes:
- All published blog posts
- Full post content
- Publication dates
- Author information
- Post categories

### JSON Feed

The site also provides a **JSON Feed** for modern feed readers:

**JSON Feed URL:** [https://k11softwaresolutions.com/blog/feed.json](https://k11softwaresolutions.com/blog/feed.json)

This feed follows the JSON Feed specification and includes:
- Latest 20 blog posts
- Full HTML content
- Publication dates
- Author information
- Tags and categories
- Post summaries/excerpts

   author: Your Name
   categories: category1 category2
   ---
   ```
